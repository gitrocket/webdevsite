    <h2>About Emile</h2>
    <p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Psychology with an emphasis in Statistics and Research Methodology. After college, I traveled to Prague and taught English as a second language for a year.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Since then, I have worked as a freelance <a href="https:www.wamstekerphotography.com">photojournalist</a> for numerous
    news gathering organizations including <span id="credits">the Associated Press, The New York Times, USA Today, the Wall
        Street Journal, Bloomberg News, and Education Week.</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>I have always loved technology.  What led me into web development was a problem I needed to solve as a photographer. I was looking for a stand-alone keyword harvester, but couldn't find anything off-the-shelf, so I built one using Python and its' Natural Language Toolkit library. It was that experience which lead me to pursue software and web development.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you are looking to hire an innovative and resourceful developer, please reach out. I am always excited to work with other developers to create problem solving applications.</p>
